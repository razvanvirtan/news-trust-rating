# News Trust Rating

As the amount of information available on the web increases, so does the quantity of so-called
fake news. Also, because of new techniques like deep fake, making the difference between real
and fake news becomes harder and harder, even for trained people. At some point, people get
tired of putting the necessary effort into assessing the truthfulness of what they read, so they
become vulnerable to manipulation. 

However, we consider that most people on the web are well-intended. Therefore, we could rely
on this to drive a community effort for assessing news level of trust.
The goal of our project is building a browser extension that allows users to see the level of
confidence that other users put into the web page they are currently browsing.
In order to measure the level of confidence, the browser extension allows users to vote if a
website they are browsing contains valid news or not. The level of confidence will be defined as: 

*number of users who voted for a website to be considered legit / total users who voted*
